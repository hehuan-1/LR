        "abstract": "Information exchange has become increasingly faster and efficient through the use of recent technological advances, such as instant messaging and social media platforms. Consequently, access to information has become easier. However, new types of cybersecurity threats that typically result in data loss and information misuse have emerged simultaneously. Therefore, maintaining data privacy in complex systems is important and necessary, particularly in organizations where the vast majority of individuals interacting with these systems is students. In most cases, students engage in data breaches and digital misconduct due to the lack of knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity and the consequences of cybercrime. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness and user compliance among undergraduate students at Majmaah University using a scientific questionnaire based on several safety factors for the use of the Internet. We quantitatively evaluated the knowledge of cybercrime and protection among students to show the need for user education, training, and awareness. In this study, we used a quantitative research methodology and conducted different statistical tests, such as ANOVA, Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett\u2019s tests, to evaluate and analyze the hypotheses. Safety concerns for electronic emails, computer viruses, phishing, forged ads, popup windows, and supplementary outbreaks on the Internet were well-examined in this study. Finally, we present recommendations based on the collected data to deal with this common problem.",

        "abstract": "Formalizing the approach towards risk management on social media is critical for organizations. Regrettably, a review of the state-of-the-art on cybersecurity training highlighted that the existing frameworks are either too generic or too cumbersome to be adapted to different organizations and needs. Thus, we developed the Adaptive Cybersecurity Training Framework for Social Media Risks (ACSTF-SMR), a framework that incorporates social media cybersecurity policies and best practices. The ACSTF-SMR enables organizations, trainers, and policymakers to address the challenges posed by social media in a way that satisfies employees\u2019 training needs and adjusts to their preferences. We tested the ACSTF-SMR with 38 case studies. Employees\u2019 behaviors, learning, and responses after training were assessed, and feedback was gathered to improve the framework. Interviews with policymakers were held to gain insight into the enforcement of social media policies. We conclude that the ACSTF-SMR is a reliable option to mitigate social media threats within organizations.",

        "abstract": "Due to the increasing number of cyber incidents and overwhelming skills shortage, it is required to evaluate the knowledge gap between cyber security education and industrial needs. As such, the objective of this study is to identify the knowledge gaps in cyber security graduates who join the cyber security workforce. We designed and performed an opinion survey by using the Cyber Security Knowledge Areas (KAs) specified in the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) that comprises 19 KAs. Our data was gathered from practitioners who work in cyber security organizations. The knowledge gap was measured and evaluated by acknowledging the assumption for employing sequent data as nominal data and improved it by deploying chi-squared test. Analyses demonstrate that there is a gap that can be utilized to enhance the quality of education. According to acquired final results, three key KAs with the highest knowledge gap are Web and Mobile Security, Security Operations and Incident Management. Also, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Software Lifecycles, and Vulnerabilities are the knowledge areas with largest difference in perception of importance between less and more experienced personnel. We discuss several suggestions to improve the cyber security curriculum in order to minimize the knowledge gaps. There is an expanding demand for executive cyber security personnel in industry. High-quality university education is required to improve the qualification of upcoming workforce. The capability and capacity of the national cyber security workforce is crucial for nations and security organizations. A wide range of skills, namely technical skills, implementation skills, management skills, and soft skills are required in new cyber security graduates. The use of each CyBOK KA in the industry was measured in response to the extent of learning in university environments. This is the first study conducted in this field, it is considered that this research can inspire the way for further researches.",

        "abstract": "Current enterprises\u2019 needs for skilled cyber-security (CS) professionals have prompted the development of diverse CS training programs and offerings. It has been noted that even though enterprise staff is now more aware of security threats, the number of successful attacks against companies has all but decreased over the years. Several criticisms were raised against current CS training offerings, which often made them inadequate, or unable to change participants\u2019 behavior and security attitude. One of the main factors CS training programs are often not very effective is the lack of engagement or motivation of participants. This is often the result of training not being tailored to the needs or preferences of participants. In our previous work, we tackled this issue by developing a personalized learning theory-based model for developing CS training frameworks. In this work, we utilize the model to develop two CS training exercises: two game-based scenarios using the CS training video game Cyber CIEGE and one table-top team exercise. The exercises are later tested by involving a group of 12 students from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU) Information Security master\u2019s degree program. According to the results of the experiment and the feedback from the students, students felt more engaged during the exercises due to having been participants in their development process. This has in turn motivated them to continue using the training tools independently in their spare time. Further research is recommended to establish whether the training development model is adequate for different target groups, as well as better performing than other models when developing full-fledged training programs.",

        "abstract": "Cyber attacks have been increasingly detrimental to networks, systems, and users, and are increasing in number and severity globally. To better predict system vulnerabilities, cybersecurity researchers are developing new and more holistic approaches to characterizing cybersecurity system risk. The process must include characterizing the human factors that contribute to cyber security vulnerabilities and risk. Rationality, expertise, and maliciousness are key human characteristics influencing cyber risk within this context, yet maliciousness is poorly characterized in the literature. There is a clear absence of literature pertaining to human factor maliciousness as it relates to cybersecurity and only limited literature relating to aspects of maliciousness in other disciplinary literatures, such as psychology, sociology, and law. In an attempt to characterize human factors as a contribution to cybersecurity risk, the Cybersecurity Collaborative Research Alliance (CSec-CRA) has developed a Human Factors risk framework. This framework identifies the characteristics of an attacker, user, or defender, all of whom may be adding to or mitigating against cyber risk. The maliciousness literature and the proposed maliciousness assessment metrics are discussed within the context of the Human Factors Framework and Ontology. Maliciousness is defined as the intent to harm. Most maliciousness cyber research to date has focused on detecting malicious software but fails to analyze an individual's intent to do harm to others by deploying malware or performing malicious attacks. Recent efforts to identify malicious human behavior as it relates to cybersecurity, include analyzing motives driving insider threats as well as user profiling analyses. However, cyber-related maliciousness is neither well-studied nor is it well understood because individuals are not forced to expose their true selves to others while performing malicious attacks. Given the difficulty of interviewing malicious-behaving individuals and the potential untrustworthy nature of their responses, we aim to explore the maliciousness as a human factor through the observable behaviors and attributes of an individual from their actions and interactions with society and networks, but to do so we will need to develop a set of analyzable metrics. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to review human maliciousness-related literature in diverse disciplines (sociology, economics, law, psychology, philosophy, informatics, terrorism, and cybersecurity); and (2) to identify an initial set of proposed assessment metrics and instruments that might be culled from in a future effort to characterize human maliciousness within the cyber realm. The future goal is to integrate these assessment metrics into holistic cybersecurity risk analyses to determine the risk an individual poses to themselves as well as other networks, systems, and/or users.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cybersecurity represents a unique national security challenge for states: data breaches with the potential for national, macro-level consequences are most likely to occur at the micro-level, originating through the security errors of individual computer users. Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to\u2014and protects themselves from\u2014cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens\u2019 cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed\u2014actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy.",

        "abstract": "With the increase in the use of Internet interconnected systems, security has become of utmost importance. One key element to guarantee an adequate level of security is being able to detect the threat as soon as possible, decreasing the risk of consequences derived from those actions. In this paper, a new metric for early detection system evaluation that takes into account the delay in detection is defined. Time aware F-score (TaF) takes into account the number of items or individual elements processed to determine if an element is an anomaly or if it is not relevant to be detected. These results are validated by means of a dual approach to cybersecurity, Operative System (OS) scan attack as part of systems and network security and the detection of depression in social media networks as part of the protection of users. Also, different approaches, oriented towards studying the impact of single item selection, are applied to final decisions. This study allows to establish that nitems selection method is usually the best option for early detection systems. TaF metric provides, as well, an adequate alternative for time sensitive detection evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Cyber hygiene is a relatively new paradigm premised on the idea that organizations and stakeholders are able to achieve additional robustness and overall cybersecurity strength by implementing and following sound security practices. It is a preventive approach entailing high organizational culture and education for information cybersecurity to enhance resilience and protect sensitive data. In an attempt to achieve high resilience of Smart Grids against negative impacts caused by different types of common, predictable but also uncommon, unexpected, and uncertain threats and keep entities safe, the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) Horizon 2020 project has created an organization-wide cyber hygiene policy and developed a Cyber Hygiene Maturity assessment Framework (CHMF). This article presents the assessment framework for evaluating Cyber Hygiene Level (CHL) in relation to the Smart Grids. Complementary to the SPEAR Cyber Hygiene Maturity Model (CHMM), we propose a self-assessment methodology based on a questionnaire for Smart Grid cyber hygiene practices evaluation. The result of the assessment can be used as a cyber-health check to define countermeasures and to reapprove cyber hygiene rules and security standards and specifications adopted by the Smart Grid operator organization. The proposed methodology is one example of a resilient approach to cybersecurity. It can be applied for the assessment of the CHL of Smart Grids operating organizations with respect to a number of recommended good practices in cyber hygiene.",
